# Chisel-Single-Cycle-RISC-V
This is the chisel generated verilog in which the instruction memory and data memory is written in verilog by my own.
Here is the Fibonacci Series running on FPGA Arty-7 xc7a35ticsg324-1L. On FPGA board we have "4 RGB" leds(LD0,LD1,LD2,LD3) where as in my case "LD0 => RGB" Blue led is the Least Significant Bit(LSB) and "LD3 => RGB" Red led is the Most Significant Bit(MSB).
